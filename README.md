This is the backend version of the project. This does use a MySQL db to hold all the data.

All the data was temporary as the pictures are random anime characters.

To run this, do to the backend foler and do "go run main.go"
next make a new session and go to the frontend and run "npm run dev"
Then to log in use the email "alicejones@gmail.com" and password "pass1234". This will not let you through if not done this way as this will authenicate the user.
